In this dataset which contains more than 1,00,000 rows, I have eliminated blanks by replacing them with N/A and also I have changed the format for price per unit and total spent. 
In this project, I have learned how to clean a dataset and remove blanks using functions like isblank(), if() statements and how to use functions like proper and trim to align the
data in the columns.
